# Frist Machine leaning end to end to project
#### Create new repositary without any files
 Once we create the repository creat folder in local system with same reposity name ex. mlproject repo name local file should be mlproject. Then open anconda promet copy the folder name and change director
    using the cd path location and type ### code . will open visual studios
#### As a next set set up with git hub to visual studios using the commandst
    'git init'
    'git add  README.md'
    'git commit -m 'first commit'
    'git push -u origin main'

once done with push commit then add new file in git such as .gitignore and the pull the file
  ' git pull'
## requirements and setup.py and src/__init__.py files 
When we create these files just install the requirements files using the below commits
    'pip install -r requirements.txt'
then all the dependence files will be update once we done just push to the branch
